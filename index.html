                <p class="quot"> "Future - A period of time following the moment of speaking or writing; time regarded as still to come."

                <p class="stan"> So future-ology means the study of the future. Astro Teller, the head of the Google X Lab, puts eloquently

                                <p class="stan">Google X labs (i.e. the crazy thought factory that comes up with some of the greatest moonshots)
                                    is currently developing the first ever driverless car. Now many of you know this already,
                                    but what does it mean for infrastructure and what are the possible future changes that
                                    we might see?</p>
                                <p class="stan">At the time of writing this article [Mar 2016], the Google driverless car has just had a
                                    slight collision with a bus whilst on a routine test-drive on public roads. As a result,
                                    a lot of people have thrown up their arms and said, “This is why it won’t be adopted”,
                                    “We can’t trust a machine” and “It can’t be done”. But in a calm reflective statement,
                                    US transport secretary, Anthony Foxx, made a very interesting point,</p>
                                <p class="quot">“I think the question here isn’t comparing the automated car against perfection, I think
                                    it’s a relative comparison to what we have now on the roads which is you and I, and our
                                    eyeballs, and our brains.”</p>
                                <p class="ref">- Anthony Foxx</p>
                                <p class="stan">Now, this highlights a common feeling amongst individuals that machines should be perfect
                                    and not subject to our own human error. Think how many times you have been frustrated
                                    by something that is badly programmed, loses your data, crashes or freezes. How we all
                                    love that blue screen of death or spinning rainbow wheel! however, is it valid to think
                                    that a machine should be perfect? After all, it is humans that program them.</p>
                                <p class="stan">At this stage of the car's development, would it not be wiser to consider this car as being
                                    similar to a learner driver? Is it such a surprise that it might have a close shave or
                                    even an accident? The thing that we are forgetting here, is that the system is being
                                    improved on a daily basis. Programmers will 'learn' from this error and this same accident
                                    becomes less likely to happen again. When they next update the system that drives the
                                    car, they will take into account the fact that buses and larger vehicles are less likely
                                    to give way and program such a rule into the system. This 'learning' of common driver
                                    knowledge (i.e. 'the rules of the road') comes with time for human drivers and the same
                                    could be said for the driverless car.</p>
                                <p class="stan">Now, let’s say this fanciful dream takes off (which I oddly pray is the case, despite my
                                    love for driving) what crazy changes would this bring? Let us get the bad stuff out of
                                    the way first. To put it bluntly, it would destroy the livelihoods of delivery personnel
                                    and taxi drivers over time. If we think about the driverless car we must also consider
                                    the creation of driverless lorries and vans. If lorries and vans were to become driverless
                                    do they really need a delivery man? A robot in the back of the van or lorry could load
                                    and unload the cargo. In the case of a home delivery, the onboard computer could text
                                    you to tell you it is outside or ping you on the delivery company's app and just say
                                    “Hey come to the van outside, we have your order”.</p>
                                <p class="stan">Taxi drivers could be hard hit too. One of the main beauties that not many individuals have
                                    considered is what happens to the driverless car once you’ve got out of it? Do you ask
                                    it to park nearby and you get out there? Or, perhaps more likely, you ask it to drop
                                    you off somewhere busy and then send it home or to a nearby parking lot to wait. Now
                                    that effectively destroys the taxi business because your car becomes your chauffeur.
                                    In theory, it could drive you to the airport, drop you off and then go home by itself.
                                    Then when you land back home, from your lovely exotic holiday, you make a quick tap on
                                    your phone's 'pick-up' app and the car will meander its way from your house to come and
                                    collect you. Who needs a taxi then? Not me! Furthermore, a driverless car means no taxi
                                    hire or designated driver on nights out. It would completely remove the need to get a
                                    taxi after a night's drinking or partying because your car won’t have any alcohol pumping
                                    round its pipes - so what could it get arrested for?
                                </p>
                                <p class="stan">No more need for taxi hire or costs of employing delivery personnel may mean more money in
                                    your pocket, but less in theirs. Driverless cars have the potential to create a massive
                                    economic blow to these service sectors and to threaten or erode the livelihoods of people
                                    who drive for a living - the disruption to their lives could be huge. </p>
                                <p class="stan">Now to the positives. I don’t know about you, but I name my cars and I have a feeling I would
                                    name my invisible chauffeur appropriately. Perhaps - Parker, Jeeves, Kit or the BatMobile!
                                    How cool would it be if at a halloween party I could ask my phone to call up the BatMobile
                                    and a matte black Lexus RX450h with a batman sticker arrives at my host's front door?
                                    Aside from that, there are many other benefits apart from me fulfilling a personal fantasy
                                    to call up the BatMobile.</p>
                                <p class="stan">Firstly, driverless cars will create more free time. Think of all those road trips where
                                    the kids or your mates get to sleep, listen to music, play video games, read books and
                                    your poor mind has to focus on keeping them alive in a tin box for sometimes up to 3
                                    to 8 hours. Wouldn’t you like some ‘me’ time? With a driverless car you could, as your
                                    invisible wheelman drives you to your next destination, read some Charles Dickens, play
                                    some video games or maybe even sleep on the way into work in the early morning. </p>
                                <p class="stan">Secondly, if all cars become driverless they could all operate under the same rule set and
                                    therefore accidents would become relatively scarce. In theory, if the system becomes
                                    advanced enough, you wouldn’t need traffic lights because the cars would all stop at
                                    the same time via a city's central control system. This city-wide smart system would
                                    also be able to reduce the amount of congestion and traffic jams as all the cars would
                                    be aware of each other and follow direction from central command.</p>
                                <p class="stan">Thirdly and finally, all cars could be running clean and possibly even for free. If we go
                                    back to the theory of how the cars can drop you off and go park, it is not a big leap
                                    to imagine that we could have designated parking lots that the car rolls into and a little
                                    arm folds out from under the car and plugs itself into a socket in the ground to recharge.
                                    The car gets clamped down by little robotic arms as it waits for you to give it a ring
                                    to come get you: so no more tyre theft or grand theft auto.</p>
                                <p clas="stan">More importantly, if we can figure out a way to make renewable energy sources a more viable
                                    option for electricity production then these cars would be clean. For example, whole
                                    parking lots or individual parking spaces could have solar panels built into the ground
                                    to charge underground batteries that then recharge the car. If this was adopted as the
                                    norm and local councils or energy providers decided not to charge you for parking there
                                    and made that renewable energy free then it would cost you little more than road tax
                                    and maintenance to run your car. It's probably a long shot, I know - but it would be
                                    brilliant.
                                </p>
                                <p class="stan">If we take this idea even further - then why would we need to own a car? Could this technology
                                    not take a huge number of cars off the road? Couldn't we have a fleet of cars in each
                                    city and we just call one up when we need it? No more permit parking, cars parked on
                                    roads to be stolen or damaged, no need for houses with garages or paved over forecourts
                                    - just cars there when needed. But perhaps not a nice thought for car manufacturers and
                                    car salesmen. On the other hand, you could argue that the car would act as your personal
                                    pod, almost like a moving living room. You could customise it like you wish; Leather
                                    chairs, sofas or a limo's interior could all be options for your personal taxi.
                                </p>
                                <p class="stan">The people that I have mentioned this technology to have pretty much said to me, “That’s
                                    cool, but you'll have to rest the wheel from my dead hands”. But it may be that future
                                    generations don't take driving tests. If someone grows up in a society filled with driverless
                                    cars then they might not want to learn how to drive and, as time goes by, those of us
                                    who remain faithful to the way of the wheel will fade. As we get older and our sight
                                    begins to fail us we will all need our own driverless cars to remain mobile.</p>
                                <p class="stan">Overall I believe a full deployment of driverless cars makes sense for city infrastructure

                            <article>
                                <p class="stan">Google X labs (i.e. the crazy thought factory that comes up with some of the greatest moonshots)
                                    is currently developing the first ever driverless car. Now many of you know this already,
                                    but what does it mean for infrastructure and what are the possible future changes that
                                    we might see?</p>
                                <p class="stan">At the time of writing this article [Mar 2016], the Google driverless car has just had a
                                    slight collision with a bus whilst on a routine test-drive on public roads. As a result,
                                    a lot of people have thrown up their arms and said, “This is why it won’t be adopted”,
                                    “We can’t trust a machine” and “It can’t be done”. But in a calm reflective statement,
                                    US transport secretary, Anthony Foxx, made a very interesting point,</p>
                                <p class="quot">“I think the question here isn’t comparing the automated car against perfection, I think
                                    it’s a relative comparison to what we have now on the roads which is you and I, and our
                                    eyeballs, and our brains.”</p>
                                <p class="ref">- Anthony Foxx</p>
                                <p class="stan">Now, this highlights a common feeling amongst individuals that machines should be perfect
                                    and not subject to our own human error. Think how many times you have been frustrated
                                    by something that is badly programmed, loses your data, crashes or freezes. How we all
                                    love that blue screen of death or spinning rainbow wheel! however, is it valid to think
                                    that a machine should be perfect? After all, it is humans that program them.</p>
                                <p class="stan">At this stage of the car's development, would it not be wiser to consider this car as being
                                    similar to a learner driver? Is it such a surprise that it might have a close shave or
                                    even an accident? The thing that we are forgetting here, is that the system is being
                                    improved on a daily basis. Programmers will 'learn' from this error and this same accident
                                    becomes less likely to happen again. When they next update the system that drives the
                                    car, they will take into account the fact that buses and larger vehicles are less likely
                                    to give way and program such a rule into the system. This 'learning' of common driver
                                    knowledge (i.e. 'the rules of the road') comes with time for human drivers and the same
                                    could be said for the driverless car.</p>
                                <p class="stan">Now, let’s say this fanciful dream takes off (which I oddly pray is the case, despite my
                                    love for driving) what crazy changes would this bring? Let us get the bad stuff out of
                                    the way first. To put it bluntly, it would destroy the livelihoods of delivery personnel
                                    and taxi drivers over time. If we think about the driverless car we must also consider
                                    the creation of driverless lorries and vans. If lorries and vans were to become driverless
                                    do they really need a delivery man? A robot in the back of the van or lorry could load
                                    and unload the cargo. In the case of a home delivery, the onboard computer could text
                                    you to tell you it is outside or ping you on the delivery company's app and just say
                                    “Hey come to the van outside, we have your order”.</p>
                                <p class="stan">Taxi drivers could be hard hit too. One of the main beauties that not many individuals have
                                    considered is what happens to the driverless car once you’ve got out of it? Do you ask
                                    it to park nearby and you get out there? Or, perhaps more likely, you ask it to drop
                                    you off somewhere busy and then send it home or to a nearby parking lot to wait. Now
                                    that effectively destroys the taxi business because your car becomes your chauffeur.
                                    In theory, it could drive you to the airport, drop you off and then go home by itself.
                                    Then when you land back home, from your lovely exotic holiday, you make a quick tap on
                                    your phone's 'pick-up' app and the car will meander its way from your house to come and
                                    collect you. Who needs a taxi then? Not me! Furthermore, a driverless car means no taxi
                                    hire or designated driver on nights out. It would completely remove the need to get a
                                    taxi after a night's drinking or partying because your car won’t have any alcohol pumping
                                    round its pipes - so what could it get arrested for?
                                </p>
                                <p class="stan">No more need for taxi hire or costs of employing delivery personnel may mean more money in
                                    your pocket, but less in theirs. Driverless cars have the potential to create a massive
                                    economic blow to these service sectors and to threaten or erode the livelihoods of people
                                    who drive for a living - the disruption to their lives could be huge. </p>
                                <p class="stan">Now to the positives. I don’t know about you, but I name my cars and I have a feeling I would
                                    name my invisible chauffeur appropriately. Perhaps - Parker, Jeeves, Kit or the BatMobile!
                                    How cool would it be if at a halloween party I could ask my phone to call up the BatMobile
                                    and a matte black Lexus RX450h with a batman sticker arrives at my host's front door?
                                    Aside from that, there are many other benefits apart from me fulfilling a personal fantasy
                                    to call up the BatMobile.</p>
                                <p class="stan">Firstly, driverless cars will create more free time. Think of all those road trips where
                                    the kids or your mates get to sleep, listen to music, play video games, read books and
                                    your poor mind has to focus on keeping them alive in a tin box for sometimes up to 3
                                    to 8 hours. Wouldn’t you like some ‘me’ time? With a driverless car you could, as your
                                    invisible wheelman drives you to your next destination, read some Charles Dickens, play
                                    some video games or maybe even sleep on the way into work in the early morning. </p>
                                <p class="stan">Secondly, if all cars become driverless they could all operate under the same rule set and
                                    therefore accidents would become relatively scarce. In theory, if the system becomes
                                    advanced enough, you wouldn’t need traffic lights because the cars would all stop at
                                    the same time via a city's central control system. This city-wide smart system would
                                    also be able to reduce the amount of congestion and traffic jams as all the cars would
                                    be aware of each other and follow direction from central command.</p>
                                <p class="stan">Thirdly and finally, all cars could be running clean and possibly even for free. If we go
                                    back to the theory of how the cars can drop you off and go park, it is not a big leap
                                    to imagine that we could have designated parking lots that the car rolls into and a little
                                    arm folds out from under the car and plugs itself into a socket in the ground to recharge.
                                    The car gets clamped down by little robotic arms as it waits for you to give it a ring
                                    to come get you: so no more tyre theft or grand theft auto.</p>
                                <p clas="stan">More importantly, if we can figure out a way to make renewable energy sources a more viable
                                    option for electricity production then these cars would be clean. For example, whole
                                    parking lots or individual parking spaces could have solar panels built into the ground
                                    to charge underground batteries that then recharge the car. If this was adopted as the
                                    norm and local councils or energy providers decided not to charge you for parking there
                                    and made that renewable energy free then it would cost you little more than road tax
                                    and maintenance to run your car. It's probably a long shot, I know - but it would be
                                    brilliant.
                                </p>
                                <p class="stan">If we take this idea even further - then why would we need to own a car? Could this technology
                                    not take a huge number of cars off the road? Couldn't we have a fleet of cars in each
                                    city and we just call one up when we need it? No more permit parking, cars parked on
                                    roads to be stolen or damaged, no need for houses with garages or paved over forecourts
                                    - just cars there when needed. But perhaps not a nice thought for car manufacturers and
                                    car salesmen. On the other hand, you could argue that the car would act as your personal
                                    pod, almost like a moving living room. You could customise it like you wish; Leather
                                    chairs, sofas or a limo's interior could all be options for your personal taxi.
                                </p>
                                <p class="stan">The people that I have mentioned this technology to have pretty much said to me, “That’s
                                    cool, but you'll have to rest the wheel from my dead hands”. But it may be that future
                                    generations don't take driving tests. If someone grows up in a society filled with driverless
                                    cars then they might not want to learn how to drive and, as time goes by, those of us
                                    who remain faithful to the way of the wheel will fade. As we get older and our sight
                                    begins to fail us we will all need our own driverless cars to remain mobile.</p>
                                <p class="stan">Overall I believe a full deployment of driverless cars makes sense for city infrastructure
                                    and could offer a raft of safety, personal and environmental benefits. But what is the
                                    roablock (pardon the pun!) to the technology being adopted? The simple answer is public
                                    opinion. As with any new technology, there is a slow rate of adoption and uptake. People
                                    remain sceptical about its likely success and safety record. There's also the natural
                                    fear of change. But, it is safe to say, the technology will come. Once it is on our roads
                                    it will be hard to ignore.</p>
