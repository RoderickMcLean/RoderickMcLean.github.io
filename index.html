					<p class="stan">An odd title for a blog, but future and ology are defined as such: </p>
                    <p class="quot"> "Future - A period of time following the moment of speaking or writing; time regarded as still to come." </p>
                    <p class="ref">— Oxford Dictionary</p>
                    <p class="quot"> "Ology - A subject of study; a branch of knowledge."</p>
                    <P class="ref">— Oxford Dictionary</P>
                    <p class="stan"> So future-ology means the study of the future. Astro Teller, the head of the Google X Lab, puts eloquently the frame of mind that this blog aims to achieve: </p>

                    <p class="stan">Therefore, this blog was created to have and make up moonshot ideas of what is possible. It aims to inform, but more importantly to discuss the most recent technological breakthroughs and how we can we use them to change the world we live in.</p>
                    <p class="stan">We will also make predictions as well as far off guesses of what is to come. No idea is too crazy. </p>

                                <article>
                                    <p class="stan">Google X labs (i.e. the crazy thought factory that comes up with some of the greatest moonshots) is currently developing the first ever driverless car. Now many of you know this already, but what does it mean for infrastructure and what are the possible future changes that we might see?</p>
                                    <p class="stan">At the time of writing this article [Mar 2016], the Google driverless car has just had a slight collision with a bus whilst on a routine test-drive on public roads. As a result, a lot of people have thrown up their arms and said, “This is why it won’t be adopted”, “We can’t trust a machine” and “It can’t be done”. But in a calm reflective statement, US transport secretary, Anthony Foxx, made a very interesting point,</p>
                                    <p class="quot">“I think the question here isn’t comparing the automated car against perfection, I think it’s a relative comparison to what we have now on the roads which is you and I, and our eyeballs, and our brains.”</p>
                                    <p class="ref">- Anthony Foxx</p>
                                    <p class="stan">Now, this highlights a common feeling amongst individuals that machines should be perfect and not subject to our own human error. Think how many times you have been frustrated by something that is badly programmed, loses your data, crashes or freezes. How we all love that blue screen of death or spinning rainbow wheel! however, is it valid to think that a machine should be perfect? After all, it is humans that program them.</p>
                                    <p class="stan">At this stage of the car's development, would it not be wiser to consider this car as being similar to a learner driver? Is it such a surprise that it might have a close shave or even an accident? The thing that we are forgetting here, is that the system is being improved on a daily basis. Programmers will 'learn' from this error and this same accident becomes less likely to happen again. When they next update the system that drives the car, they will take into account the fact that buses and larger vehicles are less likely to give way and program such a rule into the system. This 'learning' of common driver knowledge (i.e. 'the rules of the road') comes with time for human drivers and the same could be said for the driverless car.</p>
                                    <p class="stan">Now, let’s say this fanciful dream takes off (which I oddly pray is the case, despite my love for driving) what crazy changes would this bring? Let us get the bad stuff out of the way first. To put it bluntly, it would destroy the livelihoods of delivery personnel and taxi drivers over time. If we think about the driverless car we must also consider the creation of driverless lorries and vans. If lorries and vans were to become driverless do they really need a delivery man? A robot in the back of the van or lorry could load and unload the cargo. In the case of a home delivery, the onboard computer could text you to tell you it is outside or ping you on the delivery company's app and just say “Hey come to the van outside, we have your order”.</p>
                                    <p class="stan">Taxi drivers could be hard hit too. One of the main beauties that not many individuals have considered is what happens to the driverless car once you’ve got out of it? Do you ask it to park nearby and you get out there? Or, perhaps more likely, you ask it to drop you off somewhere busy and then send it home or to a nearby parking lot to wait. Now that effectively destroys the taxi business because your car becomes your chauffeur. In theory, it could drive you to the airport, drop you off and then go home by itself. Then when you land back home, from your lovely exotic holiday, you make a quick tap on your phone's 'pick-up' app and the car will meander its way from your house to come and collect you. Who needs a taxi then? Not me! Furthermore, a driverless car means no taxi hire or designated driver on nights out. It would completely remove the need to get a taxi after a night's drinking or partying because your car won’t have any alcohol pumping round its pipes - so what could it get arrested for?</p>
                                    <p class="stan">No more need for taxi hire or costs of employing delivery personnel may mean more money in your pocket, but less in theirs. Driverless cars have the potential to create a massive economic blow to these service sectors and to threaten or erode the livelihoods of people who drive for a living - the disruption to their lives could be huge. </p>
                                    <p class="stan">Now to the positives. I don’t know about you, but I name my cars and I have a feeling I would name my invisible chauffeur appropriately. Perhaps - Parker, Jeeves, Kit or the BatMobile! How cool would it be if at a halloween party I could ask my phone to call up the BatMobile and a matte black Lexus RX450h with a batman sticker arrives at my host's front door? Aside from that, there are many other benefits apart from me fulfilling a personal fantasy to call up the BatMobile.</p>
                                    <p class="stan">Firstly, driverless cars will create more free time. Think of all those road trips where the kids or your mates get to sleep, listen to music, play video games, read books and your poor mind has to focus on keeping them alive in a tin box for sometimes up to 3 to 8 hours. Wouldn’t you like some ‘me’ time? With a driverless car you could, as your invisible wheelman drives you to your next destination, read some Charles Dickens, play some video games or maybe even sleep on the way into work in the early morning. </p>
                                    <p class="stan">Secondly, if all cars become driverless they could all operate under the same rule set and therefore accidents would become relatively scarce. In theory, if the system becomes advanced enough, you wouldn’t need traffic lights because the cars would all stop at the same time via a city's central control system. This city-wide smart system would also be able to reduce the amount of congestion and traffic jams as all the cars would be aware of each other and follow direction from central command.</p>
                                    <p class="stan">Thirdly and finally, all cars could be running clean and possibly even for free. If we go back to the theory of how the cars can drop you off and go park, it is not a big leap to imagine that we could have designated parking lots that the car rolls into and a little arm folds out from under the car and plugs itself into a socket in the ground to recharge. The car gets clamped down by little robotic arms as it waits for you to give it a ring to come get you: so no more tyre theft or grand theft auto.</p>
                                    <p clas="stan">More importantly, if we can figure out a way to make renewable energy sources a more viable option for electricity production then these cars would be clean. For example, whole parking lots or individual parking spaces could have solar panels built into the ground to charge underground batteries that then recharge the car. If this was adopted as the norm and local councils or energy providers decided not to charge you for parking there and made that renewable energy free then it would cost you little more than road tax and maintenance to run your car. It's probably a long shot, I know - but it would be brilliant.</p>
                                    <p class="stan">If we take this idea even further - then why would we need to own a car? Could this technology not take a huge number of cars off the road? Couldn't we have a fleet of cars in each city and we just call one up when we need it? No more permit parking, cars parked on roads to be stolen or damaged, no need for houses with garages or paved over forecourts - just cars there when needed. But perhaps not a nice thought for car manufacturers and car salesmen. On the other hand, you could argue that the car would act as your personal pod, almost like a moving living room. You could customise it like you wish; Leather chairs, sofas or a limo's interior could all be options for your personal taxi.</p>
                                    <p class="stan">The people that I have mentioned this technology to have pretty much said to me, “That’s cool, but you'll have to rest the wheel from my dead hands”. But it may be that future generations don't take driving tests. If someone grows up in a society filled with driverless cars then they might not want to learn how to drive and, as time goes by, those of us who remain faithful to the way of the wheel will fade. As we get older and our sight begins to fail us we will all need our own driverless cars to remain mobile.</p>
                                    <p class="stan">Overall I believe a full deployment of driverless cars makes sense for city infrastructure and could offer a raft of safety, personal and environmental benefits. But what is the roablock (pardon the pun!) to the technology being adopted? The simple answer is public opinion. As with any new technology, there is a slow rate of adoption and uptake. People remain sceptical about its likely success and safety record. There's also the natural fear of change. But, it is safe to say, the technology will come. Once it is on our roads it will be hard to ignore.</p>
